#' Mexican power network
#'
#' A network of 11 core members of the 1990s Mexican power elite (Knoke 2017), 
#' three of which were successively elected presidents of Mexico: 
#' José López Portillo (1976-82), Miguel de la Madrid (1982-88), and Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-94, 
#' who was also the son of another core member, Raúl Salinas Lozano). 
#' The undirected lines connecting pairs of men represent any formal, informal, 
#' or organizational relation between a dyad; 
#' for example, “common belonging (school, sports, business, political participation), 
#' or a common interest (political power)” (Mendieta et al. 1997: 37).
