## About the package

This package assembles functions for simulating, visualising, and analysing
multimode and multilevel networks. 

Some of these functions are relied on for the [Topological Typology](https://jhollway.shinyapps.io/TopoTypo/).

## Installation

**roctopus** can be installed using the devtools package:

```R
devtools::install_bitbucket("jhollway/roctopus", auth_user = "name", password = "password")
```

where `"name"` and `"password"` are *your* bitbucket username and password. 
\(Note that this is currently not working for Windows versions of R/RStudio. We are looking into a solution.\)

You can email me for user access to the repository.


**roctopus** is part of the **Suisse Suite** of R packages for 
social and political network analysis and modelling.
