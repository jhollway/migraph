#' Power Elite
#'
#' A 2-mode network of persons serving as directors or trustees of think tanks. 
#' Think tanks are “public-policy research analysis and engagement organizations 
#' that generate policy-oriented research, analysis, and advice on domestic and international issues, 
#' thereby enabling policymakers and the public to make informed decisions about public policy” (McGann 2016: 6). 
#' The Power Elite Database (Domhoff 2016) includes information on the directors of 33 prominent think tanks in 2012. 
#' Here we include only 14 directors who held three or more seats among 20 think tanks.
