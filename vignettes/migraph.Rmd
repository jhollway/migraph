The **migraph** package offers functions for simulating, visualising, and analysing
multilevel and multimode (especially two-mode) networks.

## Simulating

> "The family - that dear octopus from whose tentacles we never quite escape, nor, in our inmost hearts, ever quite wish to.""
~ Dodie Smith

The package includes a number of functions for simulating two-mode matrices
with particular properties for use in testing and developing null models.

These include:
``r library(migraph); ls("package:migraph")[grepl("create_",ls("package:migraph"))]``

## Visualising

> "The tentacles of today reach out like an octopus to swallow yesterday."
~ Gladys Taber

The package also includes several functions for visualising two-mode matrices.

These include:
``r library(migraph); ls("package:migraph")[grepl("plot_",ls("package:migraph"))]``

## Analysing

> "Talent without discipline is like an octopus on roller skates. There's plenty of movement, but you never know if it's going to be forward, backwards, or sideways."
~ H. Jackson Brown, Jr.

Lastly, the package includes a range of functions for analysing two-mode matrices.

These include:
``r library(migraph); ls("package:migraph")[grepl("twomode_",ls("package:migraph"))]``
