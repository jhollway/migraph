#' Clustering for one-, two-, and three- mode networks
#'
#' This function offers clustering methods for one-, two-, and three-mode networks.
#' 
#' For one-mode networks, the function serves as a shallow wrapper for `igraph::transitivity`,
#' since global transitivity is a regular measure for clustering or local density in one-mode networks.
#' 
#' For two-mode networks, we calculate the proportion of three-paths in the network
#' that are closed by fourth tie to establish a "shared four-cycle" structure.
#' 
#' For three-mode networks, we calculate the proportion of three-paths spanning the two two-mode networks
#' that are closed by a fourth tie to establish a "congruent four-cycle" structure.
#' @param object A one-mode or two-mode matrix, igraph, or tidygraph
#' @param object2 Optionally, a second (two-mode) matrix, igraph, or tidygraph
#' @family one-mode measures
#' @family two-mode measures
#' @family three-mode measures
